This is a VRChat world I created in Unity a few years ago with some interactive features.  I was quite new to unity back then.

## Features
- Toggleable Mirrors: Reflects your virtual avatar
- Customizable Music Options: toggleable music options
- Dynamic Skybox Selection: switch between different skyboxes
